You can support ohai.social through our Patreon at https://patreon.com/ohaisocial

It is entirely optional to donate. We understand that not everyone is in a financial situation to spend money on a social media service and we want ohai.social to be a welcoming place for everyone, regardless of financial status.

That said, if you are able to chip in a few bucks, we very much appreciate it.

## Costs

Currently, operation of ohai.social costs around €450/month.

## FAQ
### I prefer not to use Patreon. Can I donate some other way?

Unfortunately not at the moment. Patreon saves us a lot of work as they also handle accounting and taxation of donations, so adding another platform is not really practical for us right now. We're looking into options though.

### Can I make a single donation instead of a monthly payment?

Patreon does not support one-time donations directly, however you can sign up for our Patreon and then cancel the membership after you've been charged. There is no minimum term. You'll know when your payment has gone through because you'll receive an email confirmation. 

This is annoying to do and we wish there was a better way, but this is Patreon's recommended solution: https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/204606215-Can-I-make-a-one-time-payment-
