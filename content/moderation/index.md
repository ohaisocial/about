## Moderation team

There are currently three moderators for ohai.social:

  * [@lutoma](https://ohai.social/@lutoma) (he/him) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
  * [@silsha](https://ohai.social/@silsha) (he/him) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º


## Guidelines

Our moderation guidelines can be found at . This is primarily an internal document for moderators.

## Instance defederation

We generally try to avoid suspending instances and instead prefer blocking individual accounts. But we do not hesitate to suspend instances where necessary either.

### Suspension

Grounds for direct suspension/defederation:
* Instances that clearly only exist to facilitate harassment/trolling.
* Instances that self-describe as "free speech zone" or "without moderation" or something to that effect.
* Instances that permit content that is illegal under German law.
* Automated Twitter mirrors (Mostly [BirdsiteLive](https://github.com/NicolasConstant/BirdsiteLive) instances). While they're not actively malicious, they constantly get confused with fake accounts, use up comparatively much database space and generally add relatively little value.

### Limiting

Accounts on limited instances can still be followed, but their posts do not show up in the federated timeline and there is a warning before accessing their profile.

Reasons to limit instances:

* Excessively spammy instances with a very low signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. brands.town).
* Instances that permit unmarked NSFW content.
