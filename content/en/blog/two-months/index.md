Ohai folks! Two months have passed since the launch of ohai.social.

<figure style="width: 250px; float: right; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
	<a href="announcement.png"><img src="announcement.png" alt="A screenshot of a Mastodon post from account @lutoma@chaos.social, dated November 9 2022. The text reads: Since almost all Mastodon #instances that I used to recommend to friends (like chaos.social) have closed or limited registration amid the current user influx, I've decided to once again start operating a general-purpose one at https://ohai.social. I intend to keep it running long-term and it follows the Server Covenant outlined at https://joinmastodon.org/covenant. Feel free to invite friends there!"></a>

The initial launch was a spontaneous decision. A long-time user of Mastodon, I was delighted to see it have â€˜a momentâ€™ as Twitter slowly went down the drain. Amid the massive influx of users, most public instances were overloadedâ€”for a while, there were only two servers listed as accepting new registrations on joinmastodon.org.

In this context, I decided to (once again) start operating a public Mastodon instance. As it quickly grew to several thousand users, I was busy adding additional servers and infrastructure to keep it running smoothly. Along the way, I was joined by two amazing team members who have done a great job keeping ohai.social a safe and welcoming place.

Now that the rush of new users has slowed down, I figured a blog post about the future of ohai.social and our moderation policies was in order.

## Moderation

The moderation team is currently comprised of [three volunteers](/moderation/), and our goal is to eventually grow it to 5â€“8 people. The current workload is easily handled by the three of us, so this process is not something we are looking to rush.

The tenets of our moderation policy can be summarized as:

* Moderate as little as possible, but as much as necessary;
* Protect marginalized groups;
* Moderate intent, not mere adherence to rules;
* Be mindful of the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance).

Good-faith Mastodon instances generally fall on a spectrum for moderation:

On one end, there are the so-called "free speech zones". ohai.social is definitely not such an instance, and we do not agree with the very American idea of a "marketplace of ideas" in which all possible speech must be permitted. If you are looking for this experience, ohai.social is not the place for you, and you are likely not a good cultural fit anyway.

On the other end, there are instances that have a lot of minute policies in place. A common such policy would be a requirement of content warnings for political content. There is absolutely nothing wrong with these instances. For many individuals, especially ones on the neurodivergent spectrum, it can be the only way they can use social media... We believe in self-determination when it comes to social media use. The downside of such policies can be.. inadvetently silencing marginalized groups or discourse on uncomfortable topics. So there is a definite weighing to be done.

But while, again, there is nothing wrong with these instances, this is not the experience we are trying to create with ohai.social. Instead, we are looking to be a general instance where topics such as politics can be discussed.

But this does not mean that we permit , and we do not welcome people who are contrarian for the sake of contrarian, or who constantly play "devil's advocate". When in doubt, we will err on the side of protecting marginalized group over permitting more speech.

More broadly, __use of ohai.social is a privilege, not a right__, and we reserve the right to boot anyone who diminishes everyone else's experience. We are also not going to invest our free time into amplifying speech we personally deem unconscionable. This does not mean we are going to ban everyone who says anything we disagree with, but there is a line that must not be crossed.

<!--
We are explicitly __not__ a so-called "free speech zone". Protecting marginalized groups and our user base in general will always take priority for us.

We want to make sure our new members are equally commited to keeping this a great community to be part of.


We are spread out across different time zones, and there is generally always at least one person who can quickly respond to reports.

### Moderation stats

From the start of ohai.social until the end of December we have handled 238 reports about users or posts. [time frame? 238 until end of nov. 366 until today]. 95% of reports were handled within 5 minutes after creation. The biggest cause of delays in moderation decisions are complex situations that require investigation and discussion.

As you can imagine, we often encounter unexpected situations that are not a 1:1 match with one of our rules, but still require handling. In these cases, we make ad-hoc decisions as a team. We are currently working on a moderation guidelines document in which we plan to outline the specific handling for such edge cases. It is our hope that we can add to this document over time and use it to be consistent and fair in our moderation of the instance.

We will also publish these guidelines once we feel they are in a reasonable state.

<!-- As we go along and make more moderation decisions, we are working on a moderation guidelines document that outlines our moderation practices [maybe flesh it out a bit ie "As you can imagine, we often encounter unexpected situations causing it to very much be a 'living document'"] -->

## Donations

Servers and infrastructure cost money, and ohai.social is no exception. Luckily, we have been able to lean on our community and have received a lot of donations through our Patreon without ever really advertising itâ€”Thanks a lot! While it does not yet cover our full expenses, it has been a huge help.

<!--(In our first month, we got 148,38â‚¬ via patreon. Thanks.)
(Costs in Nov were 440,86â‚¬.)
(Prepare some text for December. Donation will be around 300â‚¬. Expenses unclear - I guess around 400-500â‚¬.)-->


| Month    | Expenses | Donations |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| November | â‚¬440.38  | â‚¬148.86   |
| December | â‚¬450.00  | â‚¬300.00   |

## The future

Right now, ohai.social is legally operated by a pre-existing company owned by the main admins of the server. We set it up this way out of practical considerations: The company already had infrastructure, insurance, an accountant, and other such necessities in place. However, this does __not__ mean that we view ohai.social as a "product" or for-profit endeavor.

Instead, we are looking to establish a [registered non-profit association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_association_(Germany)) that can serve as the operator of the instance in the long term. Because of the substantial paperwork and legalese this entails, it's not something we want to rush, but it is definitely planned.

Following the news of the sale of two larger Mastodon instances, people are understandably anxious, so let's clarify a few things:

* We have no profit motive for ohai.social, and we will never sell the site.
* There will never be advertising or user tracking on ohai.social.
* It is our intention to keep the site operational indefinitely.
